# Introduction 
This repo contains a collection of Azure functions to collect data and send to Sumo Logic cloud service, and a library called sumo-function-utils for these functions.

## Create a Function App:
You need a Function app to host the execution of all your Sumo functions. Each function app let you group functions as a logic unit for easier management, deployment and sharing of resources. Please follow the section [Create a function app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function) to create a new function app. We recommend you go with a standard [App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview) plan instead of the dynamic [Consumption plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale) (which means you pay for the time the functions run, but imposes some delay). To create an App Service plan, follow the section *Create an App Service plan* in the link above.
